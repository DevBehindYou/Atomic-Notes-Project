- A note application with offline and cloud storage sync applications will provide encryption over personal data and real-time cloud sync. This note application will give the user total control over their personal data.
- The application comes with offline local storage, so you can access your notes at any time without an internet connection.
- For the safety of notes, cloud backup is available in the application with a fast cloud sync function. 
- The application is packed with a beautiful UI and user-friendly design.
