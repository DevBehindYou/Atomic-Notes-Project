# Roadmap:

Play Store Launch:

Aim to launch the app on the Google Play Store to reach a wider audience.
Follow platform-specific guidelines for app submission and optimization.

Platform Independence:

Develop web, iOS, Android, and Windows versions of the app to cater to diverse user preferences.
Ensure consistent features and user experience across all platforms.
Leverage cross-platform development frameworks like Flutter or React Native for efficient development.

# Troubleshooting:
>App Stability:
App crashes are minimized, but if encountered, ensure the latest version is installed.
If crashes persist, provide device details and steps to reproduce for support.
>
>Sync Errors:
Unstable internet connections may lead to sync errors. Verify network stability.
Manually trigger sync if automatic sync fails to resolve temporary network issues.
>
>Biometric Authentication:
Biometric authentication enhances security. Ensure device and app support.
If authentication issues arise, re-enroll biometric data and verify app permissions.
>
>Device Lock Removal:
Removing device lock can cause app instability or crashes. Recommend keeping it enabled.
If instability occurs after lock removal, consider re-enabling it or contacting support.
>
>Multiple Password Attempts:
Implement security measures to prevent brute-force attacks on non-biometric devices.
Educate users on password strength and recommend enabling device lock for added security.
